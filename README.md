This is a visual-focused version of a larger upcoming modpack currently in development. It enhances the look and feel of vanilla Minecraft while preserving its core gameplay mechanics. This version does not add any content changes but aims to elevate immersion, clarity, and performance.

Included Mods:
Sodium and Iris dramatically boost FPS and enable high-quality shader support. Hold My Items improves player interactions. Added sounds enrich the in-game atmosphere. The rest of the included mods focus on performance optimizations, quality-of-life tweaks, and visual enhancements without disrupting the vanilla experience.

Recommended Shaders & Settings:
For the best experience, use Complementary Shaders Unbound. Set Generated Normals to 400 for smoother lighting and more realistic surface detail.
All settings have been defaulted to balance beauty and performance, especially on mid-range systems.
